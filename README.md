- And soo many


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div> </div>
<span> </span>
<br />
<a> </a>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css{
    background: linear-gradient(150deg, rgba(43, 115, 204, 0.705) 60%, rgba(17, 136, 145, 0.705) 60% );
    text-align: center;
    color: white;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    font-size: 15px;
}



### Continued development

I do like to continue learning more about CSS and little more about HTML but I am more interested about CSS
I feel there is more to learn about it and yes! JavaScript too. there is a fun long way awaiting for me.
